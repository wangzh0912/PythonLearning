    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is just the fancy name of **\"divide-and-conquer with a table\"**. Instead of solving subproblems recursively, we can solve them sequentially and store their solutions in a table , so that whenever the solution to a subproblem is needed, it is already available in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefit** - You can use dynamic programming whenever a divide-and-conquer method yield an exponential number of subproblems, but only because a small number of subproblems repeated exponentially. It just makes more sense to compute each solution once and store it away in a table for later use, than recomputing it recursively everytime it is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tradeoff** - Storing the solution of each subproblem takes up computer memory. But it is still a great deal because we have transformed an exponential time problem into a problem that only costs polynomial time and space. Moreover memory is not really a big concern with nowadays' computers.\n"

    "## 2.4. Exercise: Matrix chain multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "When a matrix of dimension $m\\times p$ is multiplied to another matrix of dimension $p\\times n$, a total of $m\\times p\\times n$ multiplication is required. When we have a chain of matrix multiplying, we want to find an order that gives the minimum no. of multiplication that we need to perform. For example, given 3 matrices of dimension $\\dim(A_1) = 10\\times 100, \\dim(A_2) = 100\\times 5$ and $\\dim(A_3) = 5\\times 50$,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiplying $A_1\\times A_2$ first, then with $A_3$, i.e. $(A_1A_2)A_3$\n",
    "    - $(A_1A_2)$ needs $10\\times 100\\times 5 = 5000$ multiplications. Dimension of resultant matrix = $10\\times 5$.\n",
    "    - $(...)A_3$ needs $10\\times 5\\times 50=2500$ multiplications.\n",
    "    - Total $=5000+2500=7500$ multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiplying $A_2\\times A_3$ first, then with $A_1$, i.e. $A_1(A_2A_3)$\n",
    "    - $(A_2A_3)$ needs $100\\times 5\\times 50 = 25000$ multiplications. Dimension of resultant matrix = $100\\times 50$.\n",
    "    - $A_1(...)$ needs $10\\times 100\\times 50=50000$ multiplications.\n",
    "    - Total $=25000+50000=75000$ multiplications.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So different multiplication order makes a huge difference.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Idea:** Given a chain of matrices $A_1A_2...A_N$, we can start by spliting the chain into two, e.g. chain 1 being $A_1A_2...A_k$ and chain 2 being $A_{k+1}...A_N$, such that all multiplication on both chains are finished before the products of the two chains multiplying together. And then we choose the $k$ that costs the minimal no. of multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the dimension of the $k$th matrix be $\\dim(A_k) = m_k\\times n_k$ (and we require $n_k =m_{k+1}$ for valid multiplication). Also let $P(A_1A_2...A_N)$ be the total of no. of required multiplication of the whole chain. Try to write out the recursive definition and then the program. "
